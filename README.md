## Envoice

Invoicing made easy

## What Envoice Is

Envoice is intended to be a simple invoicing application.  Create a new invoice, print it, and mail it.  Track open invoices and send follow ups after 30, 60, and 90 days if needed.  View past invoices, and view billing by date range or by client.

## What Envoice Is Not

Envoice is not a full-featured billing application.  It's not intended for quickbooks integration, automated monthly print jobs, etc.
